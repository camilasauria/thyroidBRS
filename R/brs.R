#' Fit BRAF-RAS Score (BRS) reference centroids
#'
#' Computes the two reference centroids (BRAF-mutant and RAS-mutant) needed to
#' score the BRAF-RAS Score (BRS) of Agrawal et al. (2014), from a cohort where
#' at least some samples have a known driver mutation. The original study
#' needed exome sequencing to assign those labels, but that is only required
#' once, to fit the centroids. Scoring additional samples afterwards
#' ([predict.brs_fit()]) only needs their gene expression.
#'
#' @section Which samples define the reference groups:
#' In Agrawal et al. the two reference sets are defined by **driver mutation**:
#' set B is the BRAF-V600E-mutant tumors and set R is the RAS-mutant tumors.
#' They are *not* the BRAF-like/RAS-like classes that the BRS itself produces.
#'
#' This distinction matters when working with the published TCGA-THCA tables.
#' The column `BRAF_RAF_class` (also exposed by
#' `TCGAbiolinks::TCGAquery_subtype()`) is exactly `sign(BRAF_RAF_score)`:
#' it is the *output* of the classifier.
#' Fitting centroids on it is circular: it pulls 43 tumors with other drivers
#' and 1 RAS-mutant tumor into the "BRAF" centroid, and 68 other-driver tumors
#' into the "RAS" centroid. Use the mutation column (`BRAFV600E_RAS`,
#' restricted to `BRAF_V600E` and `RAS`) to fit, and keep `BRAF_RAF_class` /
#' `BRAF_RAF_score` for validation. See `vignette("thyroidBRS")`.
#'
#' @param expr Gene expression, features (genes) as rows and samples as
#'   columns: a numeric matrix, a
#'   [SummarizedExperiment::SummarizedExperiment] or a
#'   `Biobase::ExpressionSet` (see [containers]). Row names must be gene
#'   symbols; column names must be sample identifiers. Expression should
#'   already be on a log-like scale (e.g. `log2(TPM + 1)`); see
#'   `log2_transform` if it isn't.
#' @param labels A named character vector giving the reference group for the
#'   samples that have one, or a single string naming a column of the
#'   object's `colData()`/`pData()`. Names must match a subset of
#'   `colnames(expr)`.
#'   Values are matched case-insensitively and after collapsing runs of
#'   non-alphanumeric characters, so `"BRAF V600E"`, `"BRAF-like"` and
#'   `"braf_like"` are equivalent. The BRAF group is named by `"BRAF_V600E"`,
#'   `"BRAF"`, `"BRAF-like"`, `"BRAF-mutant"`, `"V600E"` or `"BVL"`; the RAS
#'   group by `"RAS"`, `"RAS-like"`, `"RAS-mutant"`, `"KRAS"`, `"NRAS"`,
#'   `"HRAS"` or `"RL"`. Samples with any other value, `NA`, or simply absent
#'   from `labels` are treated as unlabeled and excluded from centroid
#'   fitting, but can still be scored with [predict.brs_fit()]. An
#'   unrecognised value warns: a mis-specified label column otherwise looks
#'   exactly like a cohort that has unlabeled samples.
#' @param genes Character vector of gene symbols to use as the signature.
#'   Defaults to the alias-resolved names in [brs_genes] (70 genes; `FLJ23867`
#'   has no current symbol and is excluded).
#' @param log2_transform Logical. If `TRUE`, applies `log2(expr + 1)` to `expr`
#'   before fitting (use this if you are passing raw TPM/counts instead of
#'   already-transformed values). The choice is stored in the returned object
#'   and reused by [predict.brs_fit()], so the two can no longer disagree.
#'   Default `FALSE`.
#' @param assay Name or index of the assay to use when `expr` is a
#'   `SummarizedExperiment`. Ignored otherwise. Defaults to the first assay,
#'   with a warning when there is more than one. For GDC data the first
#'   assay is raw counts, so use `assay = "tpm_unstranded"` with
#'   `log2_transform = TRUE`, or a normalized assay of your own.
#'
#' @return An object of class `"brs_fit"`, a list with:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{genes_used}{Signature genes actually present in `expr` and used
#'       to fit the centroids.}
#'     \item{genes_missing}{Requested signature genes not found in `expr`.}
#'     \item{genes_zero_variance}{Genes dropped because they had zero
#'       variance across the reference samples (uninformative for distance).}
#'     \item{genes_missing_values}{Genes dropped because they had a missing
#'       value in at least one reference sample. Together with
#'       `genes_zero_variance` these account for every requested gene that
#'       was found but not used.}
#'     \item{gene_mean, gene_sd}{Per-gene mean/SD from the reference samples,
#'       used to z-score any sample later in [predict.brs_fit()].}
#'     \item{centroid_braf, centroid_ras}{Mean z-score profile of the
#'       BRAF-mutant and RAS-mutant reference samples.}
#'     \item{n_braf, n_ras}{Number of reference samples in each group.}

#' Score samples with a fitted BRS model
#'
#' Computes the BRAF-RAS Score (BRS) and the resulting class for every sample
#' in `newdata`, using the centroids and per-gene mean/SD stored in `object`
#' (from [brs_fit()]). `newdata` samples do not need to have been part of the
#' reference cohort used to fit those centroids, and do not need any
#' mutation/exome information.
#'
#' @section Scoring data from another platform:
#' The centroids carry the per-gene mean and SD of the cohort they were
#' fitted on. That is what makes a sample's score its own: it does not move
#' when you score it alongside a different set of samples. It is also what
#' breaks when `newdata` comes from another platform, because those means and
#' SDs no longer describe it.
#'
#' Measured on GSE33630 (Affymetrix, 49 papillary carcinomas) against
#' centroids fitted on TCGA RNA-seq: all three settings rank the tumors
#' almost identically, at Spearman 0.97, 0.98 and 0.92 against the array's
#' own signature axis, and they disagree completely on where zero falls.
#' `"reference"` calls 49 of 49 BRAF-like; `"cohort"` calls 42 and 7.
#'
#' `"cohort"` and `"rank"` fix the threshold across platforms by paying for
#' it elsewhere: each sample's score then depends on which samples it is
#' scored with. Scoring TCGA subsets of different composition against the
#' same centroids, `"reference"` gets 97.5% to 99.6% right whatever the class
#' mix, while `"cohort"` drops to 8.4% on a cohort that happens to be all
#' RAS-like.
#'
#' So: score on the platform you fitted on and keep the default. Crossing
#' platforms, prefer fitting new centroids there if you have driver-mutation
#' labels. Failing that, use these settings for the *ranking* and treat the
#' class call as unreliable. `predict()` warns when every sample lands on the
#' same side of zero, which is the usual symptom.
#'
#' @section How the score is computed:
#' Following Agrawal et al. (2014), Extended Experimental Procedures 14.1, the
#' score of a tumor `t` is the difference between its distance to the two
#' centroids,
#'
#' \deqn{BRS(t) = \|v(t) - c(B)\|_2 - \|v(t) - c(R)\|_2}
#'
#' where the distance is a normalized Euclidean distance. Here `v(t)` is the
#' sample's expression vector z-scored gene-by-gene against the reference
#' cohort, and the norm is divided by the square root of the number of
#' signature genes, so that scores stay comparable when the gene set shrinks
#' (for example because some signature genes are absent from `newdata`).
#'
#' Negative scores are BRAF-V600E-like and positive scores RAS-like. A score
#' of exactly `0` is not defined by the paper; it is assigned to `"Ras-like"`
#' here, consistent with treating the non-negative half as the RAS side.
#'
#' The BRS values published for TCGA-THCA are additionally rescaled to
#' \eqn{[-1, +1]}, by dividing the negative scores by the most negative value
#' and the positive scores by the largest one. `brs_scaled` reproduces that
#' rescaling. Note that it is a property of the *set of samples being scored*,
#' not of a sample on its own: scoring a different cohort, or a single sample,
#' gives a different (or undefined) rescaling. Use `brs_score` when you need a
#' value that is stable per sample, and `brs_scaled` when you need a value on
#' the same axis as the published figures.
#'
#' @param object A `"brs_fit"` object, as returned by [brs_fit()].
#' @param newdata Gene expression to score, in any of the forms `expr`
#'   accepts (see [containers]) and with the same gene symbol row naming as
#'   the `expr` originally passed to [brs_fit()]. Genes in
#'   `object$genes_used` missing from `newdata` are an error, since the
#'   distance calculation would then be inconsistent with how the centroids
#'   were defined.
#' @param log2_transform Logical, or `NULL` (the default) to reuse whatever
#'   was used when fitting `object`. The stored per-gene mean/SD are on that
#'   scale, so overriding it is almost always a mistake and warns.
#' @param standardize How to put `newdata` on the scale the centroids live
#'   on. `"reference"` (the default) uses the per-gene mean and SD frozen from
#'   the fit. `"cohort"` re-derives them from `newdata` itself, and `"rank"`
#'   replaces each sample's expression by within-sample ranks first. The last
#'   two need at least 3 samples. See the section below before changing it.
#' @param assay Assay to use when `newdata` is a `SummarizedExperiment`; see
#'   [brs_fit()].
#' @param ... Not used. Present for S3 consistency with [stats::predict()];
#'   anything passed here is ignored, with a warning, so that a misspelled
#'   argument name is not silently dropped.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one row per sample in `colnames(newdata)`:
#'   `sample`, `brs_score` (normalized distance difference; negative = more
#'   BRAF-like, positive = more RAS-like), `brs_scaled` (the same score
#'   rescaled to \eqn{[-1, +1]} across the scored samples, `NA` when it cannot
#'   be determined) and `brs_class` (`"Braf-like"` or `"Ras-like"`).

#' @section Resubstitution is not validation:
#' Passing the same `labels` that were used to fit the centroids measures how

#' samples split 272/119, pure noise with no signal at all still resubstitutes
#' at about 68%. Pass `fit` and this function will tell you how much of the
#' comparison is resubstitution, and warn when all of it is.
#'
#' For a real check, compare against labels that did not enter the fit.
#' For TCGA-THCA, fit on the mutation groups and validate against the
#' published `BRAF_RAF_class` and `BRAF_RAF_score`.

#' @param fit Optionally the `"brs_fit"` used to produce `predictions`, so the
#'   overlap with its reference samples can be reported.

#' @return A list with `n`, `n_concordant`, `pct_concordant`,
#'   `n_resubstituted` (samples that also defined the centroids, `NA` if

#'   predicted). The table always carries both classes on both margins, even
#'   when only one of them occurs, so that indexing it by name is safe.
