#' Expression container support
#'
#' `brs_fit()`, `predict()` and `brs_score()` accept expression as a plain
#' numeric matrix, a [SummarizedExperiment::SummarizedExperiment] or a
#' `Biobase::ExpressionSet`. Whichever you pass, the signature is matched on
#' row names, so those must be gene symbols.
#'
#' @section Choosing an assay:
#' A `SummarizedExperiment` usually carries several assays (for GDC RNA-seq:
#' `unstranded`, `tpm_unstranded`, `fpkm_unstranded`, ...). Pass the one you
#' want by name through `assay`; the first assay is used if you do not, which
#' for GDC data is raw counts and is almost certainly not what you want.
#' An `ExpressionSet` has a single `exprs()` matrix and ignores `assay`.
#'
#' @section Labels from the object:
#' When `labels` is a bare character string of length one it is looked up as a
#' column of `colData()` (or `pData()`), so `brs_fit(se, "driver_mutation")`
#' works directly on an object that carries its own sample annotation. Sample
#' names come from `colnames()`. A *named* vector of length one is a label for
#' one sample, not a column name.
#'
#' Whichever column you name, it has to hold driver-mutation status. On
#' TCGA-THCA the column giving the published BRAF-like/RAS-like class is the
#' classifier's own output, and fitting on it is circular; see the warning in
#' [brs_fit()].
#'
#' @section Microarray data:
#' Microarray expression works as input: the signature is well represented
#' on common arrays and its structure is preserved there. What does not
#' carry over from one platform to another is the *zero threshold* that
#' separates
#' the two classes, because the per-gene means and SDs stored in a `brs_fit`
#' are those of the platform it was fitted on. Fit centroids on the same
#' platform you are scoring whenever you have driver-mutation labels for it.
#' Scoring array data against RNA-seq centroids still ranks samples correctly,
#' but the class call is not trustworthy; `predict()` warns when every sample
#' lands on the same side, which is the usual symptom.
#'
#' @return This page documents the input containers the package accepts
#'   rather than a function of its own. Whichever container the expression
#'   arrives in, [brs_fit()] returns a `"brs_fit"` object and
#'   [predict.brs_fit()] returns a data frame.
