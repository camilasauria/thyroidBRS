# thyroidBRS 0.99.6

Changes from the Bioconductor review and a pass over the submission
guidelines. Nothing here changes a score.

* The vignette has an Installation section near the top, with the
  `BiocManager` instructions in an unevaluated chunk.
* No `for` loops remain in the repository. The cross-validation in the
  vignette and the block-ordering check in the tests use `lapply()`; the
  `data-raw/` scripts use `lapply()` and `vapply()`. Every script was run
  in both forms against the same inputs, and its output is unchanged.
* The vignette's `SummarizedExperiment` example is now an evaluated chunk,
  its "Background" section is titled "Introduction", and the unevaluated
  TCGA chunk says why it is not run.
* `print()` for `brs_fit` objects is documented on `?brs_fit`.

A review of the whole package against what a Bioconductor reviewer looks at
found no error in the score, and the following, all fixed:

* `brs_score()` warned that `assay` was ignored whenever one of `expr` and
  `newdata` was a `SummarizedExperiment` and the other a matrix, although
  `assay` had been used for the container. It now goes only to the side
  that is a `SummarizedExperiment`.
* `predict()` with `standardize = "rank"` and a single signature gene
  crashed inside `dimnames<-`; it now reaches the ordinary "no signature
  gene varies" error.
* Duplicated rows were only detected under the spelling the fit used, so a
  matrix carrying `ARNTL` twice scored silently against a fit that knew the
  gene as `BMAL1`. Both spellings are checked.
* `log2_transform = TRUE` on a matrix with negative values is an error
  instead of a warning followed by a cascade of `NaN` warnings.
* `predict.brs_fit()` checks that `object` is a `brs_fit`. An `assay` that
  is not a single name or index, or a numeric index out of range, is a
  package error rather than a subscript error from `SummarizedExperiment`.
* Documentation: `brs_score()` accepts containers for `newdata`; each
  reference group needs two samples; `brs_class` is `NA` for a sample with a
  missing value; `"rank"` ranks within the signature, not the transcriptome;
  the TCGA section of the vignette describes the columns of
  `thca_reference.csv`.
* The vignette's unlabeled samples are a mix of both kinds, so the chunk
  that scores them shows both classes; one sentence wrongly said that the
  99.7% cross-validation measures agreement with the original classifier.
* `inst/CITATION` gives the TCGA Research Network as a single `person`, so
  text and BibTeX renderings no longer split the name.
* The README's Provenance section names the three models that wrote parts
  of the package and no longer quotes line and commit counts that had gone
  stale; its references to `data-raw/` are links to the repository.
* Fourteen tests cover branches that had none: `ExpressionSet` with
  `labels` as a `pData()` column, the dropped-gene listing of `print()`,
  `validate_brs()` with unscored samples, input checks, one-signed
  `brs_scaled`, and the fixes above.
* `data-raw/`: the three within/between-block correlations quoted for
  GSE33630 were left over from an earlier matrix and nothing computed
  them; `portability.R` now prints them and the notes carry the recomputed
  values. `derive_signature.R` prints the consistency figures the notes
  quote (with the definition of the median stated), and stops if a worker
  fails. `record_session()` records the inputs, knobs and commit of each
  run. `validate_tcga.R` sends readers to `build_inputs.R` for the matrix
  instead of a recipe that could produce a different one; `build_inputs.R`
  passes the GDC directory to `GDCprepare()` instead of relying on its
  name. The median selection frequency quoted in the README and the notes
  is 93-97% (93.5% and 97.2%), computed over the 70 usable published genes;
  the earlier 92-97% had counted a gene absent from every annotation.

# thyroidBRS 0.99.5

Changes from a review of the package against what a Bioconductor reviewer
looks at. Nothing here changes a score: the numbers in the README and the
vignette are unchanged.

* The help-page examples now build two groups with a real difference across
  the signature, instead of fitting centroids on pure noise. The example on
  `?validate_brs` was the worst of it: the page that explains why
  resubstitution is not validation reported 75% concordance on noise. It now
  fits on 12 samples, compares against 20, and reports how many of them were
  resubstituted.
* `?brs_genes` pointed at `data-raw/`, which `.Rbuildignore` keeps out of the
  tarball, so an installed package sent readers to files it does not have.
  Those references now name the repository and link to it.
* `predict()` warns about anything passed through `...` instead of dropping
  it. A misspelled `standardise=` silently produced the default
  standardization, which decides the class threshold.
* Label values naming neither reference group are still dropped, but now
  warn. Values are matched after collapsing separators, and `KRAS`/`NRAS`/
  `HRAS` are recognised, so TCGA-shaped label columns work as written. The
  error raised when nothing matches now lists the values it saw.
* `validate_brs()` checks that `predictions` is what it claims to be, and its
  confusion table always carries both classes on both margins. It could
  previously return a 1x1 table, which broke indexing it by name.
* Genes dropped for having a missing value in the reference samples are
  recorded in the fit as `genes_missing_values` and shown by `print()`. The
  accounting of requested genes is now complete.
* `brs_fit()` and `predict()` cut the matrix down to the signature before
  applying `log2()`, rather than transforming and copying all ~60,000 rows to
  use ~70 of them. Same result.
* The test named for the published formula only re-derived the
  implementation, so a sign error in both places would have passed. It is
  renamed for what it does, and a new test pins the formula at positions
  whose score follows from the definition alone.
* `?containers` is user-facing documentation and is no longer marked
  internal; `brs_fit()` and a runtime warning both send readers to it.
* Corrected the vignette: each norm is divided by the square root of the
  number of genes, not by the number of genes.
* README documents installation with `BiocManager`.

These changes were first pushed as 0.99.4. That version number was consumed
by the submission bot while it was reporting the previous build, so it could
never receive a build report of its own; the version was incremented again
rather than leave the reviewed code unreported.

# thyroidBRS 0.99.3

* Added the `DriverMutation` biocView. The score is defined by resemblance to
  two driver-mutation transcriptional profiles, so the term belongs; the
  `SingleCell` term BiocCheck also suggested does not, as the package is bulk
  only.
* Declared the funder (`fnd`) in `Authors@R`.

# thyroidBRS 0.99.2

* Fixes from a code review of the reproducibility work. Two documented paths
  did not run: `portability.R` expected a bare matrix where
  `build_inputs.R` writes a list, and `derive_signature.R` defaulted to a
  filename holding a different structure.
* `expected_outputs.R` compared predictions by row position, so a changed
  sample set would have been reported as identical -- the one case it exists
  to catch. It now requires the same samples.
* `build_inputs.R` asserts the GSE33630 group split. Without it a change to
  the GEO annotation would have sent every array to "normal" and saved an
  empty PTC matrix silently.
* `inst/CITATION` no longer renders a version-less note when read without
  package metadata.
* Corrected an overstatement in `brs_genes.md`: the global block orientation
  was defined from the same data it is checked against, so only the per-gene
  agreement is a real result.

# thyroidBRS 0.99.1

* `inst/CITATION` is ASCII, so BiocCheck can read it: it calls
  `readCitationFile()` without package metadata, which leaves a non-ASCII
  character in an author's name with no declared encoding. This was the
  `bioc-checks` WARNING on the first build report.
* The package version in the citation is read from DESCRIPTION rather than
  written out by hand.
* `data-raw/` now builds every input matrix, the reference labels and the
  expected outputs from their sources, and records `sessionInfo()` beside
  each result. Addresses an independent reproducibility audit.
* Corrected the README: the 111 tumors held out of the centroid fit were
  described as carrying drivers other than BRAF-V600E or RAS, but 43 of them
  carry no identified driver at all.

# thyroidBRS 0.99.0

## Breaking changes

* `predict()` now returns the score defined in Agrawal et al., Extended
  Experimental Procedures 14.1 — the difference of **normalized Euclidean
  distances** to the two centroids. Previous versions returned the difference
  of *squared* distances, which has the same sign (so classes are unchanged)
  but a different magnitude and a different rank order.
* The output gains a `brs_scaled` column: the score rescaled to `[-1, 1]`
  across the scored samples, which is the axis the published TCGA-THCA values
  use.
* `brs_fit()` now records `log2_transform` in the fitted object and
  `predict()` reuses it. Previously the two could silently disagree, which
  produced meaningless scores with no error or warning.
* `brs_fit()` accepts driver-mutation labels (`"BRAF_V600E"`, `"RAS"`) as well
  as the previous `"Braf-like"`/`"Ras-like"` values, and the documentation now
  steers towards mutation status. The reference groups in the paper are
  defined by genotype; the published `BRAF_RAF_class` column is the
  classifier's own output and fitting on it is circular.

## Fixes

* `brs_fit()` errors instead of silently producing `NaN` centroids when a
  reference group has fewer than two samples.
* `brs_fit()` warns when signature genes are absent from `expr`, instead of
  dropping them silently.
* Signature genes are now resolved against whichever symbol spelling the
  expression matrix uses. `ARNTL` was renamed `BMAL1` after the paper, so
  GENCODE v36 matrices and current ones spell it differently; both now give
  the full 70 genes.
* `predict()` warns when samples cannot be scored because of missing values,
  and when duplicated row names force it to pick one row per gene.
* A score of exactly zero is documented as `"Ras-like"` rather than left to
  the reader.
* `validate_brs()` gains a `fit` argument, reports `n_resubstituted`, and
  warns when every compared sample also defined the centroids.

## Bioconductor

* Expression can now be a `SummarizedExperiment` or an `ExpressionSet` as
  well as a matrix, with `assay=` to pick the assay and `labels` optionally
  naming a `colData()`/`pData()` column. See `?containers`.
* `predict()` and `brs_score()` gain `standardize`, choosing how `newdata` is
  put on the centroids' scale: `"reference"` (the default, unchanged
  behaviour), `"cohort"` or `"rank"`. The default keeps a sample's score
  independent of the company it is scored with; the other two trade that away
  to make the class threshold usable across platforms. See
  `?predict.brs_fit`.
* `predict()` warns when every scored sample falls on the same side of zero,
  which is what a cross-platform threshold mismatch looks like.
* Added `biocViews`, `inst/CITATION`, and a `BiocStyle` vignette; version
  numbering moved to the `0.99.z` series used for Bioconductor submission.

## Other

* `brs_genes` gains `block` and `up_in`: the two row-clusters of Figure S7A
  and the group each is higher in. Refitting on TCGA-THCA recovers this split
  for 70 of 70 genes.
* `data-raw/` documents the provenance of the gene list
  (`brs_genes.md`), re-checks the symbols (`check_symbols.R`), reproduces
  the TCGA validation (`validate_tcga.R`), re-derives the signature from the
  data (`derive_signature.R`, results in `signature_rederivation.md`) and
  records what does and does not transfer to microarrays
  (`microarray_notes.md`).
* `inst/extdata/thca_reference.csv` carries the TCGA-THCA driver-mutation
  status and published BRS, so the validation does not depend on the paper's
  supplementary spreadsheet.

# thyroidBRS 0.1.0
