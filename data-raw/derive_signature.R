## Re-derive the 71-gene BRS signature from TCGA-THCA, following the
## procedure in Agrawal et al. (2014), Extended Experimental Procedures 14.1:
##
##   "First, we iteratively sub-sampled equal size sets of tumors with either
##    BRAF-V600E (B set) or RAS (R set) activating mutations. At each
##    iteration, we determined the set of differentially expressed genes
##    (q < 0.01) between B and R using the limma R package with voom
##    correction. We then selected the genes that consistently ranked at each
##    iteration among the most significant 100. This gave us a list of 71
##    genes."
##
## This is the strongest available check on the gene list, which otherwise
## rests on a transcription of a heatmap figure.
##
##   THCA_COUNTS=<derive_input.rds> Rscript data-raw/derive_signature.R
##
## THCA_COUNTS is derive_input.rds, the list build_inputs.R writes:
##
##   counts  raw gene counts, gene symbols x patient barcode
##   grp     named character vector of driver status, "BRAF_V600E" / "RAS"
##   keep    gene symbols surviving filterByExpr, the universe to test
##   coding  gene symbols that are protein-coding, for BRS_UNIVERSE=coding
##
## Following an earlier version of this header, which described a different
## structure, left `groups` NULL and the script failed on the first draw.
